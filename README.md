# Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI images into two categories: **Tumor** and **Non-Tumor**. It leverages data preprocessing, augmentation, and deep learning techniques to achieve accurate classification results.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized for consistent input dimensions.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model generalization with techniques like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping.
- **Custom CNN Model**: Includes three convolutional layers with `ReLU` activation and max-pooling layers for feature extraction.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Tracks accuracy, loss, and recall metrics for model performance evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Displays training/validation accuracy and loss trends over epochs.
